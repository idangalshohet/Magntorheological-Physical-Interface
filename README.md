# Magntorheological-Physical-Interface


Hi, thanks for getting to my master's project repository, below is a description of all the file types. 

JND.py -> runs the script for find the just noticiable differnece of the code 
          Must be run with the arduino JND.ino code

JND_plots.py --> takes data and finds the weber's coefficent as plots the data along a sigmoid 

Reaction --> finds the response time and activation time of the material 

XYtest.py --> analyses data from the shear test

Gui21 --> interface where only two magnets are actuaded within the grid (used for haptic experiment)
          Must be run with MRFI2.ino code 
Gui44 --> renders infromation with all 4 magnets 
          Must be run with comms.ino
Gui41 --> renders information with only one actuator 

pwm_current.ino --> used to measure the relation between pwm and current readings from a DC power supply
